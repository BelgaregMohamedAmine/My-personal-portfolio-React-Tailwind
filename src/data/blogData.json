This method involves extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it according to predefined rules, and then loading it into a target destination, such as a data warehouse. ETL is ideal when data quality and consistency are paramount, and the destination schema is well-defined. It requires significant upfront design but facilitates faster querying and analysis by reducing the load on the destination system."

This method is advantageous when dealing with large volumes of data and when the destination can handle flexible schemas, such as cloud-based data lakes. While ELT reduces upfront effort, it increases the processing demands on the destination system."
